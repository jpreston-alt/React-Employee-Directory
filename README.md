# [Employee-Directory](https://jpreston-alt.github.io/React-Employee-Directory/)

## Description
Employee Directory was built for the user that wants to be able to view their entire employee directory at once, and have quick access to employee information.

This application was built with React, and it taught me alot about breaking up an application's UI into components, managing component state, and responding to user events. It pulls 200 employees from the Random User API and allows the user to filter employees by name, or sort them by category.

## Technologies
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* React
* UIKit
* Create React App

## Usage
* Navigate to the [deployed appliation](https://jpreston-alt.github.io/React-Employee-Directory/).
* In order to filter employees by name, type a name into the search bar.
* In order to sort the employee list by name, email, phone number, or DOB, click on that category.
* Click on the category again to switch the sorting order.
